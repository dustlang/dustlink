# dustlink Changelog

## 2026-02-20

### Added

- Object-format probing and ingest routing for:
  - ELF64 relocatable objects
  - COFF x86_64 objects
  - Mach-O 64-bit x86_64 objects
- Archive member kind detection for mixed archives (`.a` / `.lib` workflows).
- Minimal PE and Mach-O executable output writer paths.
- Basic linker script application support for:
  - `ENTRY(...)`
  - `OUTPUT_FORMAT(...)`
  - `SEARCH_DIR(...)`
  - `INPUT(...)`
  - `GROUP(...)`

### Changed

- Expanded `--oformat` surface to include `pe` and `macho64` aliases.
- Expanded host CLI compatibility options:
  - additional alias forms (`--entry-point`, `--library-path`, `--library`, `--map-file`)
  - accepted compatibility flags consumed as no-op/value-skip where not yet semantically implemented.
- Added script-aware final output resolution so script `OUTPUT_FORMAT`/`ENTRY` can influence final link configuration when CLI did not explicitly override those values.
- Updated documentation to reflect current capabilities and known limits.

### Notes

- `dustlink` remains an internal Dust linker, not a backend wrapper.
- Full `lld` drop-in parity is still in progress.
